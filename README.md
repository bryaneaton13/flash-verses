# Flash Verses

Flash Verses is an app that will help you memorize Bible verses. You can select verses that you would like to know a little bit better, find popular verses, change the Bible version, and then go into **Flash Card** mode.

In Flash Card mode, you can choose to either see the entire verse and have the location hidden, or see the location and try to fill in the whole verse.

This takes a helpful study technique, flash cards, and applies to Scripture in a way that you can carry it around with you wherever you go.

Instead of scrolling through your social media of choice, spend some time investing in your spiritual knowledge so that you're always ready to comfort, communicate, and care for others.
